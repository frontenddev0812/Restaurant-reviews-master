#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I had to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 
This page lacked accessibility and I converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. This code has a lot of issues and was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. I had to include standard accessibility features, and make it work offline.  

### How to run this application?
1. After downloading the project save the project to your desktop. 
2. This project is locally hosted using Python. In order to run the project you will need to have Python installed. If you are on a mac, your computer probably already has Python installed. To check which verson of Python you have, in a terminal type python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. 
3. If you are using Windows you will probably need to download Python from python.org. Just to be sure that Python is not already installed type cmd to bring up the terminal. In the terminal type py -V. If you are not given a version number navigate to python.org and download the latest version. After downloading type in your terminal cd "Desktop". Then cd to the name of the project folder. Now run your server by typing py -m http.server 8000 or if you have Python 2.x type py -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000. With the server running go to your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/.
